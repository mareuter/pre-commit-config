pre-commit-config
#################

This project is meant to be used as a submodule to other repositories needing pre-commit hook configuration. It deals with Python packages at this point. The repository leverages the `setup_pre_commit_config.py` script to handle the pre-commit configuration as well. The design is borrowed heavily from https://github.com/lsst-ts/ts_pre_commit_conf.
